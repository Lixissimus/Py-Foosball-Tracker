# Py-Foosball-Tracker

You need OpenCV version >= 3.0.0 for Python to run this. Check with 
```
import cv2
print cv2.__version__
```

For Windows to allow playing local videos copy appropriate version of `opencv_ffmpeg310.dll` from `opencv\build\bin` to `Python27\`. Also you need to have ffmpeg installed and it should be in your `PATH` variable.
